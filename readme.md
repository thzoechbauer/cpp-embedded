# cpp-embedded
This project goes along with the blog https://cppembedded.wordpress.com and provides some code for embedded systems, especially for the STM32 F3 Discovery. A modified version of the "Real-Time C++"-Library by C. Kormanyos is used, see https://github.com/ckormanyos/real-time-cpp for further information on the library.
